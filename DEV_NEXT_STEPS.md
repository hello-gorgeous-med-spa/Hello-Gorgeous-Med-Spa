Next step: create/update the PR and share the Vercel preview URL.

Scope:

No new features or animations yet.

I will validate:

Typography rendering (Source Sans loading, fallbacks)

Design tokens application (colors, radii, spacing)

Global layout consistency (header/footer/body)

Page scaffolds + routing

SEO metadata presence

Desktop and mobile responsiveness

Deliverables:

Vercel preview URL

Confirmation of build status

Note any known gaps or assumptions

After approval, we will proceed with:

Framer Motion micro-interactions (hero + cards, performance-safe)

Then lead capture + LocalBusiness schema

Proceed now.
